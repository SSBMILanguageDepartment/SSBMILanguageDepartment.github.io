									<p>The SSBMI Lanuage Department has asked all employees to learn two greetings in the Tribe's heritage languages (one Nisenan & one Northern Sierra Miwok), and we are encouraging them to use these greetings in their employment capacities as part of our <strong>Greetings Initiative</strong>.</p>
									<p>Greetings are fun and easy to learn and use. Using Tribal language greetings in the workplace helps show that this is a Tribal community that values its heritage languages while reinforcing that this is a safe space for learners to use their language.
