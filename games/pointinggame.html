									<h2>Instructions for playing</h2>

									<p><strong>Players: 2-4 players and one Caller.</strong> This game is suitable for adults and children. It can be fun to point using flyswatters, but pointing with the hands or using other objects is also fine.</p>
									<p><strong>Choose your words:</strong> Pick 4-8 Nisenan words to focus on and review them together. If you are using a Sɨpaayuwá! kit from this site, you can pick from the provided wordlist. Make sure all the players are familiar with the picture cards that go with the chosen words.</p>
									<p style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>Heads-up!</strong> You can listen to each word in the Sɨpaayuwá! kit by scanning the QR code on its picture card using your phone's camera app.</p>
									<p><strong>Arrange your chosen picture cards on a wall, a table, or the floor.</strong> You may want to put painters' tape at the top of each card so that the cards stay put but can be flipped up to reveal the Nisenan word if players need to review during the game.</p>
									<p><strong>Pick one person to be the Caller.</strong> When you are just starting to learn new words, it is easiest if the Caller is able to read so that they can use the wordlist to help them during the game.</p>
									<p><strong>Play the game!</strong> The Caller calls out 1 Nisenan word from the chosen set per round. Whoever points to the correct picture fastest wins the round and earns a point. Ties are possible. The Caller determines the winner of each round and keeps score using the score card that is included in the Sɨpaayuwá! kit (or on a piece of paper).</p>
									<p><strong>Add up the points!</strong> Whoever earns the most points by the end of the game (usually 10-15 rounds) wins!</p>
									<p><strong>Play again!</strong> The more you play, the better you will remember the new words! Play a few games in a row and take turns being the Caller.</p>

									<h2>Extensions</h2>

									<p><strong>Feel like drawing?</strong> Make your own picture cards!</p>
									<p><strong>Want to make it tricky?</strong> Allow the Caller to call out words that are NOT among the chosen picture cards. Players who fall for the trick and point at a card are out.</p>
									<p><strong>Want to use this game to learn other words?</strong> You can draw or make your own picture cards. You can also play this game with words from any of the <a href="../flashcards.html" target="_blank">flashcard sets</a> the SSBMI Language department has made – just use your flashcards as picture cards (with the English side showing).</p>
									<p style="margin-left:2em;">Email the Language Department to check on the availability of the printed flashcards (all of the flashcards can be printed at home as well).</p>
