									<p>Thank you for visiting <strong>Momím Wené (Medicine Water)</strong> at the Maidu Museum & Historic Site (opening March 15)!</p>
									<p>This show is presented by the SSBMI Exhibits & Collections Center in partnership with concept:art+movement. You can find art from this show at the Maidu Museum in two exhibits titled <strong>Momím Wené</strong>, and <strong>Yatapk’oyihím Mom (Scattered Water)</strong> or <strong>Scattered Water Droplets</strong>. The Momím Wené team collaborated with the SSBMI Language Department to share Nisenan language in the titles of these exhibits.</p>
									<p>Here, you can listen to the title of the two exhibits at the Maidu Museum and <a href="#knowmore">learn more</a> about the Nisenan language.</p>

									<p style="margin-top:3em;">The artists participating in this exhibit were chosen to embody a "scattered" representation of Native viewpoints from across the region, and the Nisenan language title of the show, <strong>Yatapk’oyihím Mom (Scattered Water)</strong>, was chosen to reflect this:</p>
									<p>The word <strong>mom</strong> means 'water' and the word <strong>yatapk’oy-</strong> means 'to scatter (something)'. When linked with the ending <strong>-ihím</strong>, the resulting phrase means 'scattered water'. When you call something "scattered" in English, you could mean that it just happens to be scattered incidentally, or that some external force scattered it. When you use <strong>yatapk’oyihím</strong> to call something "scattered" in Nisenan, you are saying that some external force scattered it. Another accurate English translation of this title would be 'water that has been scattered'.</p>

									<h2>Do you want to know more?</h2>

									<p><strong>About the Tribe:</strong> The SSBMI Community has ancestral ties to the Valley and Southern Hill dialects of the Nisenan language through the Tribe's Matriarchs, <strong>Pamela Cleanso Adams</strong> and <strong>Annie Hill Murray Paris</strong>. Pamela and her relations spoke Valley Nisenan, and they shared some of their knowledge of the Nisenan language through historical documents. We have less direct information about Annie's language; however, based on where she was from and the documented language of her relations and associates, it is likely that Annie spoke Southern Hill Nisenan.</p>
									<p>The Tribe also has ancestral connections to Nisenan villages like <strong>Pusúune</strong> & <strong>Yáales</strong>, where the language has been spoken since time immemorial.</p>



									<p style="margin-top:3em;"><strong>About Nisenan:</strong> The Nisenan language, also known historically as "Southern Maidu", has been spoken in the Sacramento Valley and the western Sierra Nevada foothills since time immemorial. This includes the area now known as Roseville and the site of the Maidu Museum & Historic Site.</p>
									<p>The Nisenan language that we share here is from speakers of the Valley dialect of Nisenan like <strong>SSBMI Matriarch Pamela Cleanso Adams</strong> and her brother <strong>Tom Cleanso</strong> as well as speakers of the Southern Hill dialect such as <strong>William Joseph</strong>, <strong>Ida Hill Starkey</strong>, and <strong>Charlie Hunchup</strong>.</p>
									<p>Valley Nisenan and Southern Hill Nisenan are very similar to one another in terms of their words and grammar. To the best of our knowledge, all of the words and phrases that we share here are shared by or would be understood by the speakers of both of these dialects.</p>



									<p style="margin-top:3em;"><strong>About Maidu:</strong> Because the Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu languages are closely related, researchers classify them as members of the <strong>Maiduan language family</strong> (<a href="images/Map - Maiduan languages from Golla (2011) for Maidu Museum.png">Map 1</a> shows where these languages are spoken). Historically, researchers also called these languages and the people who spoke them <strong>Maidu</strong> (also spelled "Meidoo" or "Midoo"), differentiating them using geographic names like "Southern Maidu" as needed.</p>
									<p>The name <strong>Maidu</strong> was first used by explorer Stephen Powers in his book "The Tribes of California" in 1877. Powers recognized that Maidu people lacked a name for the larger "Tribe", and so he adapted the Konkow & Mountain Maidu word <strong>máydɨ (person, man)</strong> to be able to classify them as belonging to one "Tribe", meaning they share certain linguistic and/or cultural traits but do not necessarily form a sociopolitical unit.</p>
									<p>In 1891 in the book "Indian linguistic families of America north of Mexico", explorer/geologist John Wesley Powell abandoned Powers's name in favor of <strong>Pujunan</strong>, which he derived from the name of the Nisenan village of <strong>Pusúune</strong> (also spelled "Pushune" or "Pujuni", among other spellings).</p>
									<p>Then, in the book "The Northern Maidu" in 1905, anthropologist Roland B. Dixon resumed using the name <strong>Maidu</strong>. Researchers still use this term to classify these languages as part of a larger language family and to categorize the people who speak them in scholarly literature. When talking about the individual languages and groups of people, researchers today use more specific names like Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu.<p>
									<p>Today, however, non-specialists often use "Maidu" to refer to Mountain Maidu specifically, and this leads to misinterpretations of other uses of the name (e.g. in historical contexts where it refers to the Nisenan). To avoid confusion, we consistently call the Nisenan language <strong>Nisenan</strong>.</p>
