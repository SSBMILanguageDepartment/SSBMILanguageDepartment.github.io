									<p>Thank you for visiting <strong>Momím Wené (Medicine Water)</strong> at the Maidu Museum & Historic Site (artist reception April 12)!</p>
									<p>This show is presented by the SSBMI Exhibits & Collections Center in partnership with concept:art+movement. You can find art from this show at the Maidu Museum in two exhibits titled <strong>Momím Wené</strong> and <strong>Yatapk’oyihím Mom (Scattered Water)</strong> or <strong>Scattered Water Droplets</strong>. The Momím Wené team collaborated with the SSBMI Language Department to share Nisenan language in the titles of these exhibits.</p>
									<p>Here, you can listen to the title of the two exhibits at the Maidu Museum and <a href="#knowmore">learn more</a> about the Nisenan language.</p>

									<p style="margin-top:3em;">The artists participating in this exhibit were chosen to embody a "scattered" representation of Native viewpoints from across the region, and the Nisenan language title of the show, <strong>Yatapk’oyihím Mom (Scattered Water)</strong>, was chosen to reflect this:</p>
									<p>The word <strong>mom</strong> means 'water' and the word <strong>yatapk’oy-</strong> means 'to scatter (something)'. When linked with the ending <strong>-ihím</strong>, the resulting phrase means 'scattered water'. When you call something "scattered" in English, you could mean that it just happens to be scattered incidentally, or that some external force scattered it. When you use <strong>yatapk’oyihím</strong> to call something "scattered" in Nisenan, you are saying that some external force scattered it. Another accurate English translation of this title would be 'water that has been scattered'.</p>

									<h3 style="margin-top:1.5em;">About the SSBMI Community</h3>
									<p>The SSBMI Community has ancestral ties to the Valley and Southern Hill dialects of the Nisenan language through the Tribe's Matriarchs, <strong>Pamela Cleanso Adams</strong> and <strong>Annie Hill Murray Paris</strong>. Pamela spoke the Valley dialect and she, her brother Tom Cleanso, and her daughter Lillie Williams are responsible for passing on most of the knowledge we have of Valley Nisenan today. We have less direct information about Annie’s language; based on where she was from and documented language from her relations and associates, she likely spoke Southern Hill Nisenan.</p>
									<p>The SSBMI Community also has ancestral connections to Nisenan villages in the Sacramento Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills like <strong>Pusúune</strong>, <strong>K’ademmá</strong>, <strong>Wóllok</strong>, and <strong>Yáales</strong>, where the Nisenan language has been spoken since time immemorial.</p>



									<h3 style="margin-top:3em;">About the Nisenan Language</h3>
									<p>The Nisenan language, also known historically as "Southern Maidu", has been spoken in the Sacramento Valley and the western Sierra Nevada foothills since time immemorial. This includes the area now known as Roseville and the site of the Maidu Museum (see Map 1 below).</p>
									<p>The Nisenan language that we share here is from speakers of the Valley dialect of Nisenan like <strong>SSBMI Matriarch Pamela Cleanso Adams</strong> and her brother <strong>Tom Cleanso</strong> as well as speakers of the Southern Hill dialect such as <strong>William Joseph</strong>, <strong>Ida Hill Starkey</strong>, and <strong>Charlie Hunchup</strong>.</p>
									<p>Valley Nisenan and Southern Hill Nisenan are very similar to one another in terms of their words and grammar. To the best of our knowledge, all of the words and phrases that we share here are shared by or would be understood by the speakers of both of these dialects.</p>



									<h3 style="margin-top:3em;">About the term "Maidu"</h3>
									<p>The historical and modern uses of the term "Maidu" (also spelled "Meidoo" or "Midoo") can be confusing. To clarify, the Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu languages are distinct from each other and not mutually intelligible (meaning someone who speaks one language cannot readily understand the others). However, they are closely related, and researchers classify them together as members of the Maiduan language family (see Map 1 below to learn more about where Maiduan languages are spoken). Researchers chose the name "Maiduan" to refer to this language family because there was a scholarly tradition of calling Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu peoples "Maidu":</p>
									<p>This tradition began with the explorer Stephen Powers, who was the first to use the term "Maidu" in his book "The Tribes of California" in 1877. Powers observed some of the shared linguistic and cultural characteristics of the Konkow and Mountain Maidu peoples and wanted to classify them together as a "Tribe" for the purposes of his book (he considered the Nisenan or "Nishinam" to be a separate unit). Because these people did not consider themselves to be a unified sociopolitical entity, they did not have their own name for such a grouping. Powers created the term "Maidu" for this composite "Tribe" by adapting the Konkow and Mountain Maidu word <strong>máydɨ (person, man)</strong>.</p>
									<p>In his book "Indian linguistic families of America north of Mexico" in 1891, explorer/geologist John Wesley Powell abandoned Power's term in favor of "Pujunan", which he derived from the name of the Nisenan village of <strong>Pusúune</strong> (also spelled "Pushune", "Pujuni", and other spellings).</p>
									<p>However, in his 1905 book "The Northern Maidu", anthropologist Roland B. Dixon resumed using the name "Maidu" and extended it to include the Nisenan, and researchers after that continued to use "Maidu" to refer to the Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu peoples and languages. When researchers wanted to identify a specific community or language, they would use geographic names derived from "Maidu" like "Southern Maidu" (= Nisenan) or "Northwestern Maidu" (= Konkow), or use more precise names like "Nisenan" and "Konkow".</p>
									<p>Today, researchers still use the term "Maiduan" to refer to the language family; however, researchers and Native communities typically use more specific names like Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu to talk about individual communities and languages. That said, people speaking casually often use the term "Maidu" to refer to the Mountain Maidu people and language specifically, and this can lead to misinterpretations of historical uses of the term. In all SSBMI material, we use the terms Nisenan, Konkow, and Mountain Maidu to avoid any confusion.</p>
